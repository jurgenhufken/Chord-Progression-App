# Known Issues - Chord Progression Studio

## üêõ Active Issues

### 1. Keyboard Shortcut Cmd+Z Not Working
**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:**  
- Menu "Undo" button works correctly
- Keyboard shortcut Cmd+Z (macOS) does not trigger undo
- Event listener is registered but may be blocked or not firing
- Console logs show handleKeyboard is called but undo doesn't execute

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Make a change (e.g., split a bar)
2. Press Cmd+Z
3. Nothing happens (but menu Edit ‚Üí Undo works)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Cmd+Z should trigger undo (same as menu button)
- Cmd+Shift+Z should trigger redo

**Technical Notes:**
- Event listener: `document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => this.handleKeyboard(e))`
- Check for metaKey (Cmd on Mac) is in place: `(e.ctrlKey || e.metaKey)`
- Input field blocking works correctly
- Need to debug why event doesn't reach undo() function

### 2. Trailing Visualizer Missing
**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:**  
- No visual feedback for note trails during playback
- Would be nice to have a trailing effect showing recently played notes

**Proposed Solution:**
- Add CSS animation for note fade-out after playing
- Or add a trail line following the playhead
- Similar to DAW-style playback visualization

**Technical Notes:**
- Could use CSS transitions on `.note-block.playing` class
- Add `.note-block.recently-played` class with fade animation
- Remove class after animation completes
